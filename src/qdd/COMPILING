COMPILING
=========

If you wish to contact me, send an E-mail to: ian.chapman@amiga-hardware.com

Patches & ports are welcome :-)

It is recommended you also read the README.

1. Compiling on Linux
2. Compiling on Solaris
3. Compiling on IRIX


1. Compiling on Linux
---------------------

Qdd has only been compiled on X86 Linux with the 2.6.X series of kernels using
gcc 3.3.3. It'll probably work on other setups, feel free to try:

a. Open the file called "config.h" in a text editor.
b. Uncomment the the linux define. (ie remove // from the line)
c. Ensure the Solaris and IRIX defines are still commented out.
d. Save the file
e. Type:
   gcc -o qdd qdd.c

If all goes well, you should end up with a binary file called qdd. You can
generally ignore compiler warnings for the moment.

Please read the file config.h for other options which may be configured.


2. Compiling on Solaris
-----------------------

Qdd has only been compiled on Solaris/SPARC using gcc 3.3.2. It'll probably
work on many other setups, feel free to try:

a. Open the file called "config.h" in a text editor.
b. Uncomment the solaris define. (ie remove // from the line)
c. Ensure the Linux and IRIX defines are still commented out.
d. Save the file
e. Type:
    gcc -o qdd qdd.c -lsocket

If all goes well, you should end up with a binary file called qdd. You can
generally ignore compiler warnings for the moment.

Please read the file config.h for other options which may be configured.


3. Compiling on IRIX
--------------------

Note: Use of qdd on IRIX is not recommended at the moment.

Qdd has only been compiled on IRIX 6.5.16 using gcc 3.3. It'll probably
work on many other setups, feel free to try:

a. Open the file called "config.h" in a text editor.
b. Uncomment the IRIX define. (ie remove // from the line)
c. Ensure the Linux and Solaris defines are still commented out.
d. Save the file.
e. Type:
    gcc -o qdd qdd.c

If all goes well, you should end up with a binary file called qdd. You can
generally ignore compiler warnings for the moment.

Please read the file config.h for other options which may be configured
