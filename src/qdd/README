1. INTRODUCTION
---------------

Qdd is a small daemon which executes SCSI commands sent from Q-Device on the
local machine and sends back the reply to Q-Device for processing. Q-Device
communicates with qdd by using the pseudo device, tcpip-scsi.device.

Qdd was largely developed to give me access to more SCSI devices for further
development of Q-Device. Consequently it is not feature-full and will simply
quit at the slightest hiccup. However it's been released as some may find it
useful or interesting.


2. WARNINGS
-----------

I don't want to discourage you from trying out qdd, but it's only fair to
point out the following:

    a. This program was written with little regard to security. Therefore you
    should only consider running it on a private network. That is, a network
    which you, and only you use.

    b. Qdd by default uses UDP ports 8000 up to a maximum of 8030. The actual
    ports in use depends on the number of SCSI devices in the machine, but it's
    almost certainly going to be far less than this. You may wish to configure
    your firewall to accept UDP only, and only from your Amiga running Q-Device
    for ports 8000 to 8030 for extra security.

    c. There is no negotiation between Q-Device and the daemon. The daemon
    assumes that anything arriving on one of it's ports is a SCSI command. It
    attempts to take some precautions for this. All SCSI commands supported by
    Q-Device are 6, 10 or 12 bytes. If a packet arrives which does not match
    these sizes then qdd will automatically quit.

    d. Because of point c, there is a possibility albeit extremely low that a
    packet arrives which happens to be 6, 10 or 12 bytes and by chance happens
    to be a valid SCSI command, therefore there is the potential to damage the
    hard disks. The chances of this happening by accident are extemely low, but
    the possibility is there.

    e. NEVER NEVER NEVER attempt to connect to qdd with anything other than
    Q-Device.

    f. Only connect to qdd with the matching Q-Device. That is only use
    Q-Device V0.5 with qdd V0.5 etc.

Use of qdd and Q-Device is entirely and wholly at your own risk. You accept in
full, responsibility for any and all consequences as a result of their use.


3. COMPILING
------------

Please see the text file COMPILING


4. USAGE
--------

For qdd to be effective it should probably run with root priviledges. You
normally just type:-

./qdd

from the command line. It will then scan for devices it knows how to look for
and setup a listening port for each device. Then use Q-Device with the
tcpip-scsi.device as normal. Note: Make sure that the preferences for
tcpip-scsi.device are configured with a base port of 8000 and the hostname or
IP address of the machine running qdd.

To quit qdd, use CTRL-C or use kill <pid>, where <pid> is the process ID
obtained from using the ps command.

Please consult the platform specific notes.


5. LINUX Notes
--------------

Qdd has only been tested on 32bit X86 Linux with the 2.6.x series of kernels.
It'll probably work on any Linux running kernel 2.4.x and above with any
architecture, provided it's compiled as a 32bit binary. The provided binary
was compiled with gcc 3.3.3

It looks for devices using the SCSI generic interface, therefore it tries to
open the following devices:

/dev/sg0 through to /dev/sg30


6. SOLARIS Notes
----------------

Qdd has only been tested on Solaris/SPARC version 9. It'll probably work on
earlier versions of Solaris from 6 upwards. It'll probably also work on
Solaris/X86 and Solaris/PPC provided it's compiled as a 32bit binary.
Apparently Solaris/X86 treats IDE devices as SCSI, so qdd may use these.

Qdd on Solaris uses the USCSI interface. By default it attempts to look for
the first 8 devices on the first SCSI controller only. For example:

/dev/rdsk/c0t0d0s0 through to /dev/rdsk/c0t7d0s0

The USCSI interface only supports hard disks and tape drives, therefore other
devices such as CDROMs may not be available for use with qdd.

Unlike the Linux version, the Solaris version will quit if a SCSI command
is sent to a device which it doesn't understand.


7. IRIX Notes
-------------

Although there is support for IRIX at the moment and it even compiles, it
doesn't behave properly and so is not recommended for use yet.
